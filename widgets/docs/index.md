# Frontend Widgets for Persona Link

Interaction is 2-way and thus to offer full potential of the goals of this project, the project includes front-end widgets that connect to the persona-link server. Each widget must provide:

* a clear description of the use-case. For example, the interaction can be completely voice based, or video based or text based, or a mix.
* Engaging UX for each use-case. For example a UX that captures audio of user and renders a video avatar may require a mic button to record speech, alternatively it may have other features like hands-free, etc.
