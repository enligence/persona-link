# Persona Link
The project's aim is to make a novel step to facilitate digital human industry by making it easier for users to integrate their AI-based agents with any avatar or digital human provider. 

The main features of the project include:
1. **Interoperability**: Provides a standard interface that allows users to seamlessly integrate any AI-based agent with any avatar or digital human provider.
2. **Caching**: Caching layer that significantly improves performance by storing recurring similar requests and their responses. This means that the system won't have to exert extra computational efforts to process the similar requests from scratch.
3. **Personalization**: Personalization layer that allows users to customize their avatars or digital humans based on specific preferences or requirements.
4. **Front-end Widgets**: Front-end widgets that users can incorporate into their websites or applications. These widgets will offer a host of features that will further enhance the user experience.

As an open-source product, this project is built by the community for the community. We're looking for developers, designers, and anyone interested in digital humans and AI to contribute to this exciting project.
